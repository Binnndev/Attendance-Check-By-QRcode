# Attendance-Check-By-QRcode
This project builds a QR-code classroom attendance system with two parts: an Android app for instructors/students and a Java Spring Boot backend with MySQL. REST APIs handle login, CRUD, class join, session creation, check-in, stats, and report export, while WebSocket pushes real-time attendance updates for large classes. Scales for 100+ students!!
